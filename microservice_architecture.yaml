# Inter-Service Communication
communication:
  protocol: HTTP/REST + gRPC for high-performance services
  discovery: Consul or Kubernetes service discovery
  messaging: Redis Pub/Sub for real-time events
  authentication: JWT tokens between services

# Data Flow Patterns
data_flow:
  trading_cycle:
    - api_gateway receives request
    - trading_engine orchestrates cycle
    - market_data provides OHLCV data
    - strategy_engine evaluates strategies
    - portfolio checks risk limits
    - execution places orders
    - monitoring tracks performance

  real_time_updates:
    - WebSocket connections to market_data
    - Redis Pub/Sub for cross-service events
    - Portfolio updates via execution callbacks

# Configuration Management
configuration:
  type: centralized
  tool: Consul or etcd
  format: YAML
  hot_reload: true

# Deployment Strategy
deployment:
  local: Docker Compose
  production: Kubernetes
  scaling: Horizontal Pod Autoscaler
  health_checks: HTTP readiness/liveness probes

# Migration Strategy
migration:
  phase_1: Extract independent services (monitoring, market_data)
  phase_2: Extract core services (trading_engine, portfolio, strategy)
  phase_3: Extract execution services (execution, token_discovery)
  phase_4: Migrate frontend to use microservice APIs
  phase_5: Full microservice deployment with API gateway

# Monitoring & Observability
observability:
  logging: ELK stack or similar
  metrics: Prometheus + Grafana
  tracing: Jaeger or OpenTelemetry
  alerting: AlertManager

# Security Considerations
security:
  - Service-to-service authentication
  - API key management
  - Rate limiting per service
  - Network segmentation
  - Secret management (Vault)
