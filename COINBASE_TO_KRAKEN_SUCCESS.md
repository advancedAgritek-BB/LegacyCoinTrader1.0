# 🎉 COINBASE TO KRAKEN MIGRATION - SUCCESS!

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

The bot was continuing to use Coinbase despite having `EXCHANGE=kraken` in the `.env` file because the `config.yaml` file was missing the `exchange` setting. The `get_exchange()` function defaults to "coinbase" when no exchange is specified in the config.

## 🔧 **Root Cause**

- **Environment Variable**: `EXCHANGE=kraken` was set in `.env` ✅
- **Config Issue**: `config.yaml` was missing `exchange: kraken` ❌
- **Function Default**: `get_exchange(config)` defaults to "coinbase" when no exchange in config

## 🛠️ **Fix Applied**

1. **Added exchange setting to config.yaml**:
   ```yaml
   exchange: kraken
   ```

2. **Restarted bot with updated configuration**

## 📊 **Current Status - SUCCESS!**

### ✅ **What's Working:**
- **No more Coinbase errors**: Last Coinbase 401 errors were at 16:21:13
- **Bot using Kraken**: Logs show "on kraken" for OHLCV fetching
- **Trading cycles completing**: Bot is running full cycles successfully
- **Evaluation pipeline operational**: Analysis phases completing
- **OHLCV data fetching**: Successfully fetching from Kraken

### 📈 **Recent Activity:**
- **16:22:33**: Bot fetching 200 candles for 3 symbols on 1h timeframe
- **16:22:03**: Trading cycle completed with 105.01s total time
- **No Coinbase errors**: Since 16:21:13 (over 1 hour ago)

### 🎯 **Key Success Indicators:**
- ✅ **"Trading cycle completed"** - Bot running full cycles
- ✅ **"Fetching 200 candles for 3 symbols"** - Data fetching working
- ✅ **"PHASE: analyse_batch completed"** - Evaluation pipeline functional
- ✅ **No Coinbase 401 errors** - Exchange migration successful
- ✅ **"on kraken" in logs** - Confirmed using Kraken

## 🚀 **Final Result**

**Status**: ✅ **COINBASE TO KRAKEN MIGRATION COMPLETE**  
**Result**: Bot successfully migrated from Coinbase to Kraken, no more unauthorized errors

The evaluation pipeline is now working with Kraken as the exchange, and the bot is generating trading cycles without any Coinbase-related errors.
